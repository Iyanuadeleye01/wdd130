            Hello! My name is Iyanu Adeleye, and I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. I enjoy watching football, especially Premier League matches. I'm an avid reader with a passion for personal growth and storytelling. Spending time with friends and family brings me joy, as I value meaningful conversations and shared laughter. I am currently studying Software Web Design and Computer Programming at Brigham Young University (BYU). I also have a background in Data Science and AWS, which has helped me develop strong analytical and cloud computing skills. I believe in staying curious and making the most of every opportunity to learn and connect with others.
